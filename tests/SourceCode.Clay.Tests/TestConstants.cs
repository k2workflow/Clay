His parents divorced when he was five, and Astley was brought up by his father.[9] His musical career started when he was ten, singing in the local church choir.[10] During his schooldays, Astley formed and played the drums in a number of local bands, where he met guitarist David Morris.[2][11] After leaving school at sixteen, Astley was employed during the day as a driver in his father's market-gardening business and played drums on the Northern club circuit at night in bands such as Give Way – specialising in covering Beatles and Shadows songs – and FBI, which won several local talent competitions.[10]";
